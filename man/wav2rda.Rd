\title{Find the pulses in a bunch of wav files and save them to rda files}
\usage{
wav2rda(path, te.factor = 10, channel = c("right", "left"), window.ms = 2,
  min.contour = 10, min.peak = 20, n.fourier = 30)
}
\arguments{
\item{path}{The path of the wav files. The function will reach recursive in
the subdirectories of the path.}

\item{te.factor}{The time-expansion factor used in the wav files. Defaults
to 10.}

\item{channel}{Which channel will be read. Defaults to "right".}

\item{window.ms}{The size of the window for fourier transformation of the
sound in milliseconds. The time-expansion factor is taken into account.
Defaults to 1.}

\item{min.contour}{The minimum amplitude to mark the start of a pulse.
Expressed in dB above the median amplitude of the wav file.}

\item{min.peak}{The required maximum amplitude of a pulse. Pulses with a
maximum amplitude below min.peak will be ignored.}

\item{n.fourier}{The number of parameters of the Fourier Transformation to
store per dimension. Defaults to 30.}
